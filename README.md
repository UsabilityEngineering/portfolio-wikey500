# Sean Minami's UX portfolio

I'm Sean Minami, and I'm a Computer Science student doing my last year at Chico State.  One reason I'm interested in this class is the amount of UI design work I've been doing at work recently.  I'm hoping that this class may help me make better decisions in the layouts I make.  My interests include working on cars, driving, and listening to music.
